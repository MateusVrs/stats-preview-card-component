## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- CSS Flexbox

````css
.card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
````

- CSS Grid

```css
main {
    display: grid;
    align-items: center;
}
.attribution {
    grid-area: 3;
}
.card {
    grid-area: 2;
}
```


### Continued development

This was my first project built with HTML and CSS, so I learned a lot here. The final result isn't as good as I expected, but for my first code I think it's fine.
